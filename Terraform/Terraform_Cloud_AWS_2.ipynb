    "**Notes:**\n",
    "As Terraform usage continues to increase across the organization, your team needs a better way to store and organize everyone's Terraform code. Until now you haven't had much testing or code review for infrastructure changes. Jane, the QA lead, introduces herself:\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍🎤 Hi sysadmin, we're trying to implement better quality assurance around our infrastructure deployment process. Can you help me add the **hashicat-aws** GitHub repository to the workspace so we can implement code reviews?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you connect a VCS repository to your Terraform Cloud workspace, **all** changes to the code must be stored in the VCS before Terraform will execute them. This ensures that you have no unauthorized changes to your infrastructure as code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition it allows you to enable features like code reviews, pull requests, and automated testing of your code."

    "\n",
    "In order for different teams and individuals to be able to work on the same Terraform code, you need to use a Version Control System (VCS). Terraform Cloud can integrate with the most popular VCS systems including GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: You will need a free GitHub.com account for this challenge. We recommend using a personal account for training instead of your work account."
